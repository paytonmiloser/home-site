    "text": "I prioritize building a supportive environment where students can actively explore and apply statistics and data science. I‚Äôve helped design hands-on activities and real-world data projects that connect theory to practice, helping students see the relevance of concepts beyond the classroom. I focus on demystifying complex mathematical and programming ideas by breaking them into manageable steps and encouraging peer collaboration. By consistently inviting questions and feedback, I tailor my instruction to address individual challenges and promote growth. Ultimately, I want students not only to understand statistics technically but to develop the confidence to analyze data critically and communicate their insights clearly."

My work often engages with real-world data from environmental and agricultural contexts, where flexible modeling and thoughtful inference are essential.\nI am currently working with Dr.¬†Jarad Niemi for my Ph.D."
